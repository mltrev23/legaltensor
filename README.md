## 🛠️ Architecture Overview

Legaltensor operates as a Bittensor subnet with a miner-validator structure:

1. **Validators**  
   - Query miners with legal tasks.  
   - Validate the quality and reliability of responses.  
   - Store validated responses in the distributed system.

2. **Miners**  
   - Process tasks using the Saul-7B-Base model.  
   - Respond to queries from validators with high-quality outputs.  
   - Utilize the LegalBench dataset for task-specific benchmarks.
